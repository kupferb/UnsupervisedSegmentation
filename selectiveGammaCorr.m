function imm = selectiveGammaCorr(imm, alfa)
% Performs a gamma correction only on pixels with an intensity greater than
% the threshold obtained with the Otsu method and sets the others to zero. 
% This is because the lesion is generally lighter and is located to the right
% of the Otsu threshold, while the pizels on the left will not be part of the mask.
